# Churn Prediction in the Banking Sector

-> This simple project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector by building and comparing traditional machine learning models and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

-> The primary objective is to evaluate model performance not only using accuracy, but also through confusion matrices and classification metrics such as recall and F1-score, which are critical for imbalanced churn datasets.

-> Additionally, model performance is improved through feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and decision threshold optimization(ANN) to reduce false negatives and enhance churn detection.

-> kindly if you find issues and have any suggestion, you are welcome to fork and contribute
